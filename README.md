DB Engine Using Bash Script (#Hend Tawfek & #Reem Shkeep) 
Introduction

    This project is about implementing a DBMS (Database Management System) using Bash Script language

    It was a good practice to develop our skills in Bash Script and know more about its syntax, also know more about Linux commands

    To deal with tables structures we needed to use AWK, sed, and output redirection >>

    We presented some validation features like:

        Null Values

        If tables and databases exist

        Prevent creation of duplicate names for tables and databases

    Also the terminal shows friendly instructions to user to direct him to enter valid and proper inputs

    A Menu with flexible navigation forward and backward options is presented too
